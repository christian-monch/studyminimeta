# studyminimeta

A minimalistic metadata description for datasets. It rose out of our need to capture metadata about existing datasets that were about to be archived. Its purpose is to allow the poeple responsible for the dataset, e.g. authors, curators, researchers, to provide relevant metadata for our archiving with minimal effort. At the same time, the description is flexible enough to support capturing of publications that used the dataset and of poeple involved.

The project includes a JSON schema that defines the metadata format and tools that validate a metadata description w.r.t. the schema and to internal consistency rules.
